# ITS (IMAGE TO SPEECH)
Mission: The idea of this project is to design a software "FREE TO USE AND WITHOUT POP OUT ADDS AND WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS INSIDE THE MAIN FUNCTIONS"
who: for users, parents and professional providers who require a mobile program to provide a way to communicate and understand with a person with non-verbal ability.

where :The implementation of this software is expected to be on IOS, IPAD OS, and Android from the current version from 01/01/2022 and future updates. The program will never charge for functionality, and any modification of this software will not restrict the functionality. 

 It will be an option for a developer to implement a Help developers area with donations or watch an ad to help developers but will never show an ad without the end-user's consent and will never show an ad outside the Help developer area.
